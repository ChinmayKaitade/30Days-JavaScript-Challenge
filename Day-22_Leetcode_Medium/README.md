## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Add Two Numbers**_

- **Task 1:** Solve the 'Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
  - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**_

- **Task 2:** Solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters' problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
  - Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Container With Most Water**_

- **Task 3:** Solve the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.
  - Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: 3Sum**_

- **Task 4:** Solve the 3Sum problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.
  - Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Group Anagrams**_

- **Task 5:** Solve the "Group Anagrams" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.
  - Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.

<hr/>
