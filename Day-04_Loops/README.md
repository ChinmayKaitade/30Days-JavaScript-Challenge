### Achievement üèÜ

By the end of these activities, students will:

- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.

- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.

- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.

- Use loop control statements (break and continue) to control the flow of loops.
