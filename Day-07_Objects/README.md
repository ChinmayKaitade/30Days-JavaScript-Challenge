![Day-07 Code Snap](Day-07%20Code%20Snap.png)

## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Object Creation and Access**_

- **Task 1:** Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year, and log the object to the console. 

- **Task 2:** Access and log the title and author properties of the book object.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Object Methods**_

- **Task 3:** Add a method to the book object that returns a string with the book's title and author, and log the result of calling this method. 

- **Task 4:** Add a method to the book object that takes a parameter (year) and updates the book's year property, then log the updated object.


<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Nested Objects**_

- **Task 5:** Create a nested object representing a library with properties like name and books (an array of book objects), and log the library object to the console. 

- **Task 6:** Access and log the name of the library and the titles of all the books in the library.


<hr/>

_**Activity 4: The `this` Keyword**_

- **Task 7:** Add a method to the book object that uses the `this` keyword to return a string with the book's title and year, and log the result of calling this method.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Object Iteration**_

- **Task 8:** Use a `for...in` loop to iterate over the properties of the book object and log each property and its value.

- **Task 9:** Use `Object.keys` and `Object.values` methods to log all the keys and values of the book object.

### Feature Request üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Book Object Script:** Write a script that creates a book object, adds methods to it, and logs its properties and method results. 


2. **Library Object Script:** Create a script that defines a library object containing an array of book objects and logs the library's details.

3. **Object Iteration Script**  Write a script that demonstrates iterating over an object's properties using `for...In` loop and `Object.keys/Object.values`.


### Achievement üèÜ

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- Understand and use the this keyword in object methods.
- Work with nested objects and arrays of objects.
- Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.
