## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Basic Recursion**_

- **Task 1:** Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Log the result for a few test cases.

- **Task 2:** Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Log the result for a few test cases.

_**Activity 2: Recursion with Arrays**_

- **Task 3:** Write a recursive function to find the sum of all elements in an array. Log the result for a few test cases

- **Task 4:** Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: String Manipulation with Recursion**_

- **Task 5:** Write a recursive function to reverse a string. Log the result for a few test cases.

- **Task 6:** Write a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome. Log the result for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Recursive Search**_

- **Task 7:** Write a recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array. Log the index of the target element for a few test cases.

- **Task 8:** Write a recursive function to count the occurrences of a target element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Tree Traversal (Optional)**_

- **Task 9:** Write a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree. Log the nodes as they are visited.

- **Task 10:** Write a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree. Log the result for a few test cases.
