# Day-20 : LocalStorage and SessionStorage üçµ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Understanding LocalStorage**_

- **Task 1:** Write a script to save a string value to localStorage and retrieve it. Log the retrieved value.

- **Task 2:** Write a script to save an object to localStorage by converting it to a JSON string. Retrieve and parse the object, then log it.

_**Activity 5: Comparing LocalStorage and SessionStorage**_

- **Task 9:** Write a function that accepts a key and a value, and saves the value to both localStorage and sessionStorage. Retrieve and log the values from both storage mechanisms.
