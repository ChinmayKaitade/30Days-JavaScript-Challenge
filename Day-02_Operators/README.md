## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations**_

- **Task 1:** Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 2:** Write a Program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 3:** Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 4:** Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 5:** Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

_**Activity 2: Assignment Operators**_

- **Task 6:** Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
- **Task 7:** Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Comparison Operators**_

- **Task 8:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` log the result to the console.
- **Task 9:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` log the result to the console.
- **Task 10:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` log the result to the console.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Logical Operators**_

- **Task 11:** Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 12:** Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 13:** Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate condition and log the result to the console.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Ternary Operator**_

- **Task 14:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.

### Feature Request üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Arithmetic Operations Script:** Write a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two numbers and logs the results.

2. **Comparison and Logical Operators:** Create a script that compares two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.

3. **Ternary Operator Script:** Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.

### Achievement üèÜ

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Understand and use arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
