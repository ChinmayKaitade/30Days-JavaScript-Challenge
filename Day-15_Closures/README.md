# Day-15 : Closures üçµ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

![Day-15 Code Snap](Day-15%20Code%20Snap.png)

## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Understanding Closures**_

- **Task 1:** Write a function that returns another function, where the inner function accesses a variable from the outer function's scope. Call the inner function and log the result.

- **Task 2:** Create a closure that maintains a private counter. Implement functions to increment and get the current value of the counter.

_**Activity 2: Practical Closures**_

- **Task 3:** Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep track of the last generated ID and increment it with each call.

- **Task 4:** Create a closure that captures a user's name and returns a function that greets the user by name.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Closures in Loops**_

- **Task 5:** Write a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function logs the correct index.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Module Pattern**_

- **Task 6:** Use closures to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implement methods to add, remove, and list items.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Memoization**_

- **Task 7:** Write a function that memoizes the results of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations.

- **Task 8:** Create a memoized version of a function that calculates the factorial of a number.

### Feature Request üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Basic Closure Script:** Write a script that demonstrates a basic closure with a function returning another function that accesses the outer function's variable.

2. **Counter Closure Script:** Create a script that uses a closure to maintain a private counter with increment and get functions.

3. **Unique ID Generator Script:** Write a script that generates unique IDs using a closure to keep track of the last generated ID.

4. **Loop Closure Script:** Create a script that demonstrates closures in loops to ensure functions log the correct index.

5. **Memoization Script:** Write a script that memoizes the results of a function and demonstrates it with a factorial calculation.

### Achievement üèÜ

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Understand and create closures in JavaScript.

- Use closures to maintain private state and create encapsulated modules.

- Apply closures in practical scenarios like generating unique IDs and memoization.

- Use closures in loops to capture and use variables correctly.
