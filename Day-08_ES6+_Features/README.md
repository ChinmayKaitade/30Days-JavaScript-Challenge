# Day-08 : ES6+ Features 🍵❤️‍🔥

![Day-08 Code Snap](Day-08%20Code%20Snap.png)

## Tasks | Activities 🌟

_**Activity 1: Template Literals**_

- **Task 1:** Use template literals to create a string that includes variables for a person's name and age, and log the string to the console. 

- **Task 2:** Create a multi-line string using the template literals and log it to the console.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Destructuring**_

- **Task 3:** Use array destructuring to extract the first and second elements from an array of numbers and log them to the console.

- **Task 4:** Use Object destructuring to extract the title and author from a book object and log them to the console.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Spread and Rest Operators**_

- **Task 5:** Use the spread operator to create a new array that includes all elements of an existing array plus additional elements, and log the new array to the console. 

- **Task 6:** Use the rest operator in a function to accept an arbitrary number of arguments, sum them, and return the result.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Default Parameters**_

- **Task 7:** Write a function that takes two parameters and returns their product, with the second parameter having a default value of 1. Log the result of calling this function with and without the second parameter.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Enhanced Object Literals**_

- **Task 8:** Use enhanced object literals to create an object with methods and properties, and log the object to the console.

- **Task 9:** Create an object with computed property names based on variables and log the object to the console.

<hr/>

### Feature Request 🙇‍♂️

1. **Template Literals Script:** Write a script that demonstrates the use of template literals to create and log strings with embedded variables and multi-line strings. 

2. **Destructuring Script:** Create a script that uses array and object destructuring to extract values and log them.

3. **Spread and Rest Operators Script**  Write a script that demonstrates the use of the spread operator to combine arrays and the rest operator to handle multiple function arguments.

4. **Default Parameters Script**  Create a script that defines a function with default parameters and log the results of calling it with different arguments.

5. **Enhanced Object Literals Script**  Write a script that uses enhanced object literals to create and log an object with methods and computed property names.

### Achievement 🏆

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Understand and use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- Apply destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects.
- Utilize spread and rest operators for array manipulation and function arguments.
- Define functions with default parameters.
- Create objects using enhanced object literals, including methods and computed property names.
