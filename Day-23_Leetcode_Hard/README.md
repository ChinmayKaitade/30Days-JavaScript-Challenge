## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Median of Two Sorted Arrays**_

- **Task 1:** Solve the "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the median of the two sorted arrays.
  - Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Merge k Sorted Lists**_

- **Task 2:** Solve the "Merge k Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an array of ik linked lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists into one sorted linked list.
  - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Trapping Rain Water**_

- **Task 3:** Solve the "Trapping Rain Water" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.
  - Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: N-Queens**_

- **Task 4:** Solve the 'N-Queens' problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that places n queens on an nen chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
  - Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Word Ladder**_

- **Task 5:** Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on 1 LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed ward must exist in the word list.
  - Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.
