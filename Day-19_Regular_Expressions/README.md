## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Basic Regular Expressions**_

- **Task 1:** Write a regular expression to match a simple pattern (e.g., match all occurrences of the word "JavaScript in a string). Log the matches.

- **Task 2:** Write a regular expression to match all digits in a string. Log the matches.

_**Activity 2: Character Classes and Quantifiers**_

- **Task 3:** Write a regular expression to match all words in a string that start with a capital letter. Log the matches.

- **Task 4:** Write a regular expression to match all sequences of one or more digits in a string. Log the matches.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Grouping and Capturing**_

- **Task 5:** Write a regular expression to capture the area code, central office code, and line number from a US phone number format (e.g., (123) 456-7890). Log the captures.

- **Task 6:** Write a regular expression to capture the username and domain from an email address. Log the captures.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Assertions and Boundaries**_

- **Task 7:** Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the beginning of a string. Log the matches.

- **Task 8:** Write a regular expression to match a word only if it is at the end of a string. Log the matches.
