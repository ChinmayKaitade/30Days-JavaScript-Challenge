## Tasks | Activities 🌟

_**Activity 1: Class Definition**_

- **Task 1:** Define a class `Person` with properties `name` and `age`, and a method to return a greeting message. Create an instance of the class and log the greeting message.

- **Task 2:** Add a method to the `Person` class that updates the age property and logs the updated age.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Class Inheritance**_

- **Task 3:** Define a class `Student` that extends the `Person` class. Add a property `studentID` and a method to return the student ID. Create an instance of the `Student` class and log the student ID.

- **Task 4:** Override the greeting method in the `Student` class to include the student ID in the message. Log the overridden greeting message.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Static Methods and Properties**_

- **Task 5:** Add a static method to the `Person` class that returns a generic greeting message. Call this static method without creating an instance of the class and log the message.

- **Task 6:** Add a static property to the `Student` class to keep track of the number of students created. Increment this property in the constructor and log the total number of students.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Getters and Setters**_

- **Task 7:** Add a getter method to the `Person` class to return the full name (assume a `firstName` and `LastName` property). Create an instance and log the full name using the getter.

- **Task 8:** Add a setter method to the `Person` class to update the name properties (`firstName` and `LastName`). Update the name using the setter and log the updated full name.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Private Fields (Optional)**_

- **Task 9:** Define a class `Account` with private fields for `balance` and a method to deposit and withdraw money. Ensure that the balance can only be updated through these methods.

- **Task 10:** Create an instance of the `Account` class and test the deposit and withdraw methods, logging the balance after each operation.

### Feature Request 🙇‍♂️

1. **Basic Class Script:** Write a script that defines a `Person` class with properties and methods, creates instances, and logs messages.

2. **Class Inheritance Script:** Create a script that defines a `Student` class extending `Person`, overrides methods, and logs the results.

3. **Static Methods and Properties Script:** Write a script that demonstrates static methods and properties in classes.

4. **Getters and Setters Script:** Create a script that uses getters and setters in a class.

5. **Private Fields Script:** Write a script that defines a class with private fields and methods to manipulate these fields (optional).

### Achievement 🏆

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Define and use classes with properties and methods.

- Implement inheritance to extend classes.

- Utilize static methods and properties.

- Apply getters and setters for encapsulation.

- Understand and use private fields in classes (optional).
