## Tasks | Activities 🌟

_**Activity 1: Two Sum**_

- **Task 1:** Solve the "Two Sum" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a target number, and returns the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
  - Log the indices for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Reverse Integer**_

- **Task 2:** Solve the "Reverse Integer problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an integer and returns it with its digits reversed.
  - Handle edge cases like negative numbers and numbers ending in zero.
  - Log the reversed integers for a few test cases.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Palindrome Number**_

- **Task 3:** Solve the "Palindrome Number" problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes an integer and returns true if it i t is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
  - Log the result for a few test cases, including edge cases like negative numbers.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Merge Two Sorted Lists**_

- **Task 4:** Solve the "Merge Two Sorted Lists problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes two sorted linked lists and returns a new sorted list by merging them.
  - Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Valid Parentheses**_

- **Task 5:** Solve the 'Valid Parentheses problem on LeetCode.

  - Write a function that takes a string containing just the characters(), [], '' and T', and determines if the input string is valid.
  - A string is valid if open brackets are closed in the correct order.
  - Log the result for a few test cases.
