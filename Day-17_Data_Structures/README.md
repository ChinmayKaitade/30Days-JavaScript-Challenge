![Day-17 Code Snap](Day-17%20Code%20Snap.png)

## Tasks | Activities üåü

_**Activity 1: Linked List**_

- **Task 1:** Implement a `Node` class to represent an element in a linked list with properties `value` and `next`.

- **Task 2:** Implement a `LinkedList` class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes.

<hr/>

_**Activity 2: Stack**_

- **Task 3:** Implement a `Stack` class with methods `push` (add element), pop (remove element), and `peek` (view the top element).

- **Task 4:** Use the `Stack` class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.

<hr/>

_**Activity 3: Queue**_

- **Task 5:** Implement a `Queue` class with methods enqueue (add element), `dequeue` (remove element), and `front` (view the first element).

- **Task 6:** Use the `Queue` class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

<hr/>

_**Activity 4: Binary Tree**_

- **Task 7:** Implement a `TreeNode` class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties `value`, `left`, and `right`.

- **Task 8:** Implement a `BinaryTree` class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

<hr/>

_**Activity 5: Graph (Optional)**_

- **Task 9:** Implement a `Graph` class with methods to add vertices, add edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).

- **Task 10:** Use the `Graph` class to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.

### Feature Request üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Linked List Script:** Write a script that implements a linked list with methods to add, remove, and display nodes.

2. **Stack Script:** Create a script that implements a stack and uses it to reverse a string.

3. **Queue Script:** Write a script that implements a queue and simulates a printer queue.

4. **Binary Tree Script:** Create a script that implements a binary tree with insertion and in-order traversal methods.

5. **Graph Script:** Write a script that implements a graph and performs breadth-first search (optional).

### Achievement üèÜ

By the end of these activities, you will:

- Implement and use linked lists for dynamic data storage. 

- Use stacks for LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) operations and reverse data.

- Use queues for FIFO (First-in-First-Out) operations and simulate real-world scenarios.

- Implement binary trees for hierarchical data storage and traversal.

- Understand and use graphs for network representations and pathfinding (optional).
